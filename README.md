# Ultralytics YOLO11

**Ultralytics YOLO11** – a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model designed for efficient and accurate object detection, segmentation, pose estimation, image classification, and more! Built on the success of previous YOLO versions, YOLO11 introduces new features, enhancements, and optimizations that push the limits of performance and flexibility.

This repository will guide you through using YOLO11, as well as how to contribute to its development. If you're looking to get started as a developer, the following sections provide detailed instructions on 

`how to contribute`, `run the code`, and `make the most of this incredible model`.

## Overview

**YOLO11** is the latest version of the YOLO series developed by Ultralytics. It improves upon the previous YOLO models with enhanced accuracy and speed, making it ideal for a range of tasks such as:

- **Object Detection and Tracking**

- **Instance Segmentation**

- **Image Classification**

- **Pose Estimation**


YOLO11 is built for high performance with **PyTorch** and supports **ONNX** for easy deployment across various platforms.

## Installation

Before using YOLO11, ensure that you have Python >= 3.8 and PyTorch >= 1.8 installed in your environment.

### Installing via pip:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

For other installation methods (such as **Conda**, **Docker**, or **Git**), please refer to our [Quickstart Guide](https://ultralytics.com/docs).

## Usage

You can use **YOLO11** via the **CLI** or **Python API** for tasks such as prediction, training, and model export.

### CLI Usage:

To perform object detection with the `yolo` command:

```bash
yolo predict model=yolo11n.pt source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'
```

For additional options, refer to the [YOLO CLI Docs](https://ultralytics.com/docs).

### Python API Usage:

To use YOLO11 within a Python script, follow the example below:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pre-trained model
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

# Train the model
train_results = model.train(
    data="coco8.yaml",  # Path to dataset YAML
    epochs=100,  # Number of epochs
    imgsz=640,  # Image size
    device="cpu",  # Device (e.g., device=0 for GPU)
)

# Evaluate model performance
metrics = model.val()

# Perform object detection
results = model("path/to/image.jpg")
results[0].show()

# Export the model to ONNX format
path = model.export(format="onnx")
```
